  description: The phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B,
    where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by
    the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting
    all other chemical constituents of A. In accordance with common usage in geophysical
    disciplines, "flux" implies per unit area, called "flux density" in physics.   'Sinking'
    is the gravitational settling of particulate matter suspended in a liquid. A sinking
    flux is positive downwards and is calculated relative to the movement of the surrounding
    fluid.

  description: 'Sea water salinity is the salt content of sea water, often on the
    Practical Salinity Scale of 1978. However, the unqualified term ''salinity'' is
    generic and does not necessarily imply any particular method of calculation. The
    units of salinity are dimensionless and the units attribute should normally be
    given as 1e-3 or 0.001 i.e. parts per thousand. '

  description: This may differ from "surface temperature" in regions of sea ice or
    floating ice shelves. For models using conservative temperature as the prognostic
    field, they should report the top ocean layer as surface potential temperature,
    which is the same as surface in situ temperature.
